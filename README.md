# Intel® how-to code samples cloud setup

This repository contains the setup information needed to add IoT cloud support to the Intel® how-to code samples.

The following cloud services are currently supported:

- Amazon\* Web Services\* (AWS\*)
- AT&T\* M2X\* IoT
- GE\* Predix\* IoT
- IBM\* Bluemix\* Internet of Things
- Microsoft\* Azure\* IoT Hub.
- SAP\* Cloud Platform Internet of Things

Start by using the guide that corresponds to your backend environment (e.g., Microsoft\* Azure\*) to set up whatever needed cloud services. Then use the guide that corresponds to your programming language (e.g., C++) to add support to your code.
